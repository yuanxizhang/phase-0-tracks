Here are some tips on avoiding bugs in the first place:

Name your variables well. Problems will leap out at you much more easily if your code is readable.
Indent your code properly. It's a lot easier to see a missing (or extra!) end keyword this way.
Don't pack too much code onto one line. The line number of an error message isn't very helpful if that line has 20 method calls on it.
Read a lot of code. The more literate you are with code, the easier it will be to see any potential problems.
Test your code frequently. Don't write 15 lines of code and then wade through 6 error messages. You can't rely on Ruby to catch every problem for you. Every single time you write a line of code, predict what it will return, and verify that in IRB. Only add a few lines to your program at a time before testing it. Make sure you can explain every single line of code in your program.
Commit frequently. If you check out your previous few commits and find a commit where the bug doesn't exist, guess what? You just figured out which commit broke your program. Some companies have automated tools that roll back through the commit history of a project to find the bug-free commit.
